<p>When you think or hear the term “green technology”, the first thing that probably comes to your mind is scientists designing solar or wind equipment. However, green technology is more than that. It is the systematic  treatment of art. </p>

<h2>The goals of green technology includes:</h2>

<p>Providing for all our daily needs without depleting the natural resources or harming the environment.

<p>Designs that can be renewed so that the engineering products can be reclaimed for future uses instead of a use and throw approach.</p>

<p>Reduction of sources, that is change the production waste and the consumption waste.
To find the alternative  to unhealthy technologies such as fossil fuel.</p>

<p>To capitalize on the products and activities that benefit human health and the environment so that they can be easily adopted.</p>

Every human being has to play a role to save the environment and the earth for future generations. You have to adopt green habits. Adopt them as soon as possible as a new routine in your life. Green technology needs a systematic approach. You start it and influence others to join too. you have to bring a change at work place too. start a recycling programs, facilitate energy efficient building features, buy eco-friendly products and allow flexible work at home schedule so that the travel expenses and the building space needs are reduced. If you have no idea about green technology then you can gather info from the web, books, attend seminar and classes.  Try to innovate green practices and adopt them. You can even make money through green technology. You can set up a home based business on green technology with your ideas.</p>

Green technology helps you save money

<p>If you have a doubt in mind that green technologies cost a lot of money then remember that it all depends on why the cost is? At the car dealership a car will cost more than a car equipped with gasoline. However, you can recoup the amount you have spent in extra through better fuel efficiency and low repair costs. The gasoline cars pollute the air a lot and the government takes a part of pay as taxes to clean the air, therefore we can pay less if we pollute the air less.</p>

<p>When you look on the consumer aspect, when you buy a household cleaner, it might be cheap per ounce than a green cleaner. It is for the reason that the green cleaners do not get enough viability. Until they get enough viability and market share so that they can be produced on a large scale. If everybody buys the green version then the companies producing then can offer these green home cleaners for a low price. The cost factor is also because of the environment protection costs which the green companies pay for and the chemical company does not pay yet. One example is production waste. A chemical cleaner company can dispose the wastes, solid or liquid without any cost. However the green company typically uses the green technology to cause less pollution to the environment.</p>
